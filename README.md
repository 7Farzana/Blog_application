Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create a full-stack blog web application where users
can create, view, update, and delete blog posts. Additionally, users should be able 
to upload images along with their blog posts to enhance their content. No database 
is required at this step.

Deliverables:
• One Node.js project for the function of the website.
• At least one EJS file for the structure of the website.
• At least one CSS file for the styling of the website.
• At least one JS file for scripting some behaviors of the website.

Features:
1. Post Creation: Users can create new blog posts with titles, bodies, and 
image uploads.
2. Post Viewing: The home page displays all blog posts with their titles, bodies
and associated images.
3. Post Update/Delete: Users can edit and delete their own blog posts as 
needed.
4. Image Upload: Users can upload images along with their blog posts to 
visually enhance their content.

Technical Requirements:
1. Node.js & Express.js: The application will be a web server built using 
Node.js and Express.js. Express.js will handle routing and middleware.
2. EJS: EJS will be used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML 
based on the application's state.
3. Multer: Multer will be used to handle image uploads.
4. Deployment: Deploy the finished project to a hosting service like Heroku or 
Netlify for real-world accessibility.
